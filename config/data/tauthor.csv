#
# CSV-based URL Action Definition
#
# This is the definition of url actions as GET or POST including parameters and validation.
# 
# Format Details and defaults when not set 
# 
# Type:			action (A) or static content (S), defaults to A (optional)
# Name:			the name of the action (Action-<recordNumber>) (optional)
# URL:			an url (mandatory)
# Method:		which method of GET or POST, defaults to GET
# Parameters:	which parameters to send (none), when GET, this can be already part of the url 
                (optional)
# ResponseCode:	which http response code is expected, defaults to 200 (optional)
# XPath:		XPath for validation (none) only used when TURL (optional)
# RegExp:		regexp for validation (none) only used when TLWURL (optional)
# Text:			Text for validation against the xpath/regexp result or just searched on the page,
                no default text (optional) 
# Encoded:		whether or not url and parameters are already encoded, defaults to false (optional) 
#
# Comments and empty lines are permitted. Header lines have to be valid. Additional header lines
# are not permitted as well as the spelling has to match including upper/lower-casing.
#
# Additional placeholders give you the ability to insert random data into the lines. The columns
# URL, Parameters, XPath, Text, and RegExp support it.
#
# ${NOW} : Current timestamp in milliseconds
# ${RANDOM.String(x)} : a random string with length x. Contains [A-Za-z].   
# ${RANDOM.String(x, s)} : a random string with length x. Contains characters from s.   
# ${RANDOM.Number(max)} : returns an integer between 0 (inclusive) and max (inclusive)   
# ${RANDOM.Number(min, max)} : returns an integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive)   
# ${foobar} : Looks up the property foobar from the properties. Normal fallback mode. 
#
# Additionally you can use DATA which is an instance if the GeneralDataProvider. So things like
# ${DATA.getStreet(false)} or ${DATA.getTrulyUniqueEmail("xyzqtar987654.com")} will work.
# You can basically write a lot into this command, because it is a beanshell. 
#
# A special feature are the columns xpath1 to xpath10. You can get any data from the page using
# these. They will end up in variables xpath1 to xpath10 and can be used in any expression later.
#
# When running the LW based test, you have to use regexp1 to regexp10 instead. If you specify
# a capturing group, the group data will end up in regexp1[1] or higher.
#
# The interpretation of ${something} starts with the property lookup. Only if no property is
# found, the beanshell interpretation will take place.
#
# The character $ is NOT supported within the commands right now.
